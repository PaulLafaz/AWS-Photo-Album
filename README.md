# AWS-Photo-Album

This repository contains code from my photo album website I created whilst studying 
Cloud Achitecture at Swinburne University.

The user could access the website to upload photos as well as their details and then either 
display the entire collection of photos in the database or perform a search to fiter out the 
photos of their choice.

Few important things worth noting are:

* The website was hosted on an AWS instance using Apache HTTP Server (which was installed in the insatnce).
* The photos the user uploaded were stored on an AWS bucket.
* The photo details were stored in a AWS RDS Database.
* The data table population was achieved using PHP MyAdmin.
* There was is not CSS or Javascripet implemented on the website.

Here are some photos for you to look:
